 A NHS GP Appointment No-Show Prediction Streamlit Web app

MediPredict is a data-driven  web application developed using Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of a patient missing their GP appointment or attending their scheduled appointment. It also features an interactive dashboard for easy visualization and understanding of the data that contributes to patient no-shows. This assists healthcare providers in improving resource allocation, reducing missed appointments, enhancing patient management, and understanding the factors that lead to no-shows.


# Features
Predicting patient no-shows based on real-world open-source data from Kaggle.

- An interactive streamlit dashboard infused in the streamlit web app for easy visualization of important attributes like no-show by age, gender, SMS received, etc, which contributes to the probability of no-show.

- Secure login system. This is to enable only authorized users to have access to patient data.
- User-friendly interface accessible from any browser to enable users with no coding experience to navigate freely.
- A prediction page where authorized users input real-time patient data for prediction to be made based on the input data while displaying  the probability.
